# Pig-Game
This is a simple web version of the Pig game which was first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. Pig is a simple dice game in which, each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold". The first player to score 100 points wins the game.

# GAME RULES :

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach [FINAL SCORE] points on GLOBAL score wins the game!
